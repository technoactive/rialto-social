Private room Details section 
This is the text that should be there ‘’ The Private Room
An intimate setting for up to 20 guests, where Venetian artistry meets contemporary spirit. The walls are adorned with bespoke graffiti murals by our local maestro, Uncle Stubble—bold, expressive, and unmistakably Rialto. Overhead, hand-blown glass fixtures from a hidden workshop in Venice cast a warm, golden glow, inviting conversation and celebration. Ideal for private dinners, spirited gatherings, or moments that deserve a touch of magic.
